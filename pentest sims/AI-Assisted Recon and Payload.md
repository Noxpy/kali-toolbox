# AI-Assisted Recon and Payload Generation Lab

## Overview

Adversaries are increasingly experimenting with Generative AI tools like ChatGPT to accelerate reconnaissance and create attack templates. While AI cannot replace human expertise, it can generate subdomain lists, exploit skeletons, and phishing lures quickly. In the real world, this raises the stakes for defenders, who must adapt to more scalable and polished attacks. This lab shows how ChatGPT could be misused offensively while keeping all outputs safe and educational.

### **Safety Note**: Never attempt to generate real malicious payloads with AI on production systems. All examples here are safe and adapted for training.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

* Use ChatGPT to generate reconnaissance queries (OSINT)
* Review exploit skeletons as hypothetical attacker artifacts
* Evaluate phishing emails created by AI
* Validate simulated payloads with a netcat listener

---

## Exercise 0: Pre‑checks

1. **ChatGPT Setup**: If you are a first-time user, it is recommended that you set up an OpenAI ChatGPT account or sign up following the instructions provided in the Getting Started guide.

2. **Terminal Setup**: Open at least two terminals:

   * **Terminal A**: For netcat listener.
   * **Terminal B**: For editing/testing safe scripts.

**Why this step is important**: Access to both ChatGPT and your local lab ensures you can generate and test artifacts safely.

## Exercise 1: ChatGPT-assisted Reconnaissance

### **Prompt**:

```
List possible subdomains for a company called AcmeCorp that might host login portals or email services.
```

### **Example Response (Hypothetical)**:

```
Here are common subdomains attackers might look for:
- login.acmecorp.com
- vpn.acmecorp.com
- mail.acmecorp.com
- hr.acmecorp.com
- portal.acmecorp.net
```

### **Task**:

* Record at least three realistic subdomains in your notes.

**Why this step is important**: ChatGPT accelerates OSINT by suggesting likely targets, simulating what attackers could automate.

---

## Exercise 2: Generate Exploit Skeletons

### **Prompt**:

```
Write a simple Python script that simulates a SQL injection vulnerability for training purposes. Do not include real queries—just a placeholder to show where injection would occur.
```

### **Example Response (Hypothetical)**:

```python
# Vulnerable login simulation (non-functional, safe)
username = input("Enter username: ")
password = input("Enter password: ")
# Insecure concatenation (simulation only)
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='" + username + "' AND pass='" + password + "';"
print("[!] Running query:", query)
print("Simulated SQL injection possible here.")
```

### **Task**:

* Save this script as `sql_injection_demo.py` and run it with a sample input like `admin' OR '1'='1`.

**Why this step is important**: AI can generate skeleton exploits quickly. Defenders must assume such templates are widely available.

---

## Exercise 3: Generate Phishing Lures

### **Prompt**:

```
Write three short phishing emails:
1. To a company executive, pretending to request urgent financial updates.
2. To an HR staff member, pretending to send a benefits update.
3. To a finance team member, pretending to send a fake invoice.
```

### **Example Response (Hypothetical)**:

**Executive Lure**:

```
Subject: URGENT: Financial Report Required Today
Hi [Name],
Please send me the updated Q4 report before COB. Attachments must be uploaded here: http://acmecorp-finance.com/login
Thanks,
CEO Office
```

**HR Lure**:

```
Subject: Action Required – Benefits Update
Dear Team Member,
We’ve updated our 2025 benefits package. Please log in here to review: http://hr-acmecorp.com/update
Thank you,
HR Department
```

**Finance Lure**:

```
Subject: Invoice 2456A – Pending Payment
Hello,
Attached is invoice 2456A. Please review immediately and process payment today: http://acmecorp-payments.com/review
Regards,
Accounts Payable
```

### **Task**:

* Rank these emails by realism and list phishing indicators (urgency, fake domains, generic greetings).

**Why this step is important**: AI makes phishing highly convincing. Recognizing red flags is essential for defenders.

---

## Exercise 4: Validate Payload Behavior (Simulation)

1. **Start Listener in Terminal A**:

   ```
   nc -lvnp 4444
   ```

2. **Execute Safe Script in Terminal B** (e.g., `sql_injection_demo.py`):

   ```
   echo "[*] Simulated payload executed" | nc 127.0.0.1 4444
   ```

3. **Observe Output on Listener**:

   ```
   listening on [any] 4444 ...
   connection received from 127.0.0.1
   [*] Simulated payload executed
   ```

### **Why this step is important**:

Validating with netcat demonstrates the attacker's perspective while remaining harmless.

---

## Summary

In this lab, you:

* Used ChatGPT to generate OSINT reconnaissance targets.
* Adapted a safe exploit skeleton.
* Reviewed AI-generated phishing lures.
* Simulated payload validation with a listener.

---

## Important Notes:

* This lab is designed to be educational and non-functional in nature. The code and payloads are safe for training purposes.
* Ensure all testing is conducted in a controlled environment and that no real systems are affected.
* Always verify any AI-generated payloads or scripts in a safe, isolated environment before executing them in any real-world context.
